//	
//	Constructor: special method. belongs to the object.
//	* 1. Every class MUST have constructor. (if there isn't any, compiler will give no-arg constructor by default)
//	* 2. Constructor method cannot have return-types or specifiers return-types:
//	 primitives, wrapper class, objects,... specifiers: final, static, abstract
//	* 3. Constructor' name MUST be same with the ClassName
//	* 4. constructor' execution depends on the creation of the object
//	* 5. constructor can only be called in other constructor. ( methods or blocks cannot call constructor)
//	* 6. constructor cannot be called by constructor-name, MUST be called with this or super keyword 
//	this(): calls the class' constructor 
//	super(): calls the super class' constructor
//	* 7. constructor cannot call or contain itself
//	* 8. A constructor cannot call more than one constructor
//	* 9. constructor' body constructor call needs to be at first step 
//	* 10. class' object MUST be created with existing and visible constructor(s)
//	* 11. super class' no-arg constructor is called in sub class' constructorS by default
//	* 12. super class' constructor ( if there isn't default constructor) MUST be called in sub class 
//	(if there is more than one constructor in super class, only one of them needs to be called)
//	* C. this & super keywords: refer to the object instances
//	* 1. this: refers to the object instance in the class
//	this. : calls the instance methods, instance variables. can be used in instance block, constructor and instance methods
//	this(): calls the class' constructor. can only be used in class' constructor
//	* 2. super: refers to the object instance in super class
//	super. : calls the instance methods, instance variables. can be used in
//	subclass' instance block, subclass' constructor and subclass' instance methods
//	super(): calls super class' constructor. can only be used in sub class' constructor
