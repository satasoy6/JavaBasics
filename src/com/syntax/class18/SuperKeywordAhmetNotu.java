//	Super Keyword
//	For inheritance we use "super" keyword.
//	The keyword super can be used to access any data member or methods of the parent class.
//	Super keyword can be used at variable, method and constructor level.
//	Why multiple inheritance is not supported in java?
//	To reduce the complexity and simplify the language, multiple inheritance is not supported in java. If there is more than one super class it can be confusing which one is inherited.
//	Default superclass: Except Object class, which has no superclass, every class has one and only one direct superclass (single inheritance). If there is any superclass, object class is superclass.
//	Superclass can only be one: A superclass can have any number of subclasses. But a subclass can have only one superclass. This is because Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes. Although with interfaces, multiple inheritance is supported by java.
//	Inheriting Constructors: A subclass inherits all the members (fields, methods, and nested classes) from its superclass. Constructors are not members, so they are not inherited by subclasses, but the constructor of the superclass can be invoked from the subclass.
//	Private member inheritance: A subclass does not inherit the private members of its parent class. However, if the superclass has public or protected methods (like getters and setters) for accessing its private fields, these can also be used by the subclass.
